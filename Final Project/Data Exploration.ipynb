    "The dataset that we will be using is the dataset on Lighting, Exposure, and Attractiveness. The data looks at examining if the lighting conditions of a picture changes the perceived attractiveness of a person in that picture. In a separate study, they researchers looked at if changing the exposure changes the attractiveness of a person. Before even starting, I did some research on pictures and the impacts of lighting and exposure. There are many ways to manipulate light in order to convey certain emotions, and it is very much related to exposure which is how much light reaches the camera sensor. "
