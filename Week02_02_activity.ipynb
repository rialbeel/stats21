(thinking question) Think it through as a team using either the full wordle data or Trump's tweets -- what kinds of questions could we ask/answer with the data (you do not need to know how to program the solution, this is more about brainstorming together)?  I'll give you an example - what is the typical length Trump's tweets?  This might be interesting if we had information on date/time of the tweet (we do, but that's for later) and using length as a proxy for complexity."
